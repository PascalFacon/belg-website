# BELG — Under Construction

**BELG** is a creative music collective where the echoes of the past meet the sound of the future.  
We’re exploring Belgian pop history, reimagining classic tracks from the ’80s, ’90s, and ’00s to craft immersive compositions in Dolby Atmos.

## About This Repository

This repository contains the code for [BELG’s](https://www.belg.io) placeholder webpage, letting visitors know that we’re hard at work behind the scenes. We’ve set up a retro-futuristic, dark '90s vibe to reflect our electronic music influences.
